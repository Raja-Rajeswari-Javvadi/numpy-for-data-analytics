# 📊 NumPy for Data Analytics – Practice Repository

This repository documents my **complete NumPy learning journey**, focused on building a **strong foundation for Data Analytics and Data Science roles** through hands-on practice.

The goal of this repository is to understand how NumPy is used for **numerical computing, data manipulation, and analytical operations**, which form the backbone of libraries like Pandas, SciPy, and Scikit-learn.

---

## 🚀 Objective

- Build a solid understanding of NumPy fundamentals  
- Learn efficient numerical operations using arrays  
- Apply NumPy concepts to real-world data analytics use cases  
- Strengthen foundations for Pandas, SQL, Power BI, and Machine Learning  

---

## 🧠 What is NumPy?

**NumPy (Numerical Python)** is a powerful Python library used for:
- High-performance numerical computations  
- Multi-dimensional array handling  
- Mathematical and statistical operations  
- Data preprocessing and analysis  

It is one of the **most important libraries** in the data analytics ecosystem.
